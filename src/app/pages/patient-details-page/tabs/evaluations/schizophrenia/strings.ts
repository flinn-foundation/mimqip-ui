If the patient has frequent contact with someone (e.g., family member) who initiates the contact, does the patient appear to desire the contact (i.e., would he or she initiate contact if necessary?)? In making this rating, probe the desire to initiate social interactions, number of social interactions, and the ability to enjoy them.",

The patient presents with poorly groomed hair, disheveled clothing, etc. Do not rate grooming as poor if it is simply done in what one might consider poor taste (e.g., wild hairdo or excessive makeup). In addition to observation, one must ask the patient about regularity of bathing, brushing teeth, changing clothes, etc. This is particularly important with outpatients, as the patient may present his or her best grooming and hygiene at their clinic visit. Two dimensions to keep in mind when making this rating are current appearance and regularity of grooming behaviors."
