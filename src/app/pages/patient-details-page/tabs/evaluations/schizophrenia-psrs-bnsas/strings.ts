  "Unusual, odd, strange or bizarre thought content. Rate the degree of unusualness, not the degree of disorganization of speech. Delusions are patently absurd, clearly false or bizarre ideas that are expressed with full conviction. Consider the patient to have full conviction if he/she has acted as though the delusional belief were true. Ideas of reference/persecution can be differentiated from delusions in that ideas are expressed with much doubt and contain more elements of reality. Include thought insertion, withdrawal and broadcast. Include grandiose, somatic and persecutory delusions even if rated elsewhere.Note: If Suspiciousness is rated \"5\" or \"6\" due to delusions, then Unusual Thought Content must be rated a \"3\" or above.",
  "Reports of perceptual experiences in the absence of relevant external stimuli. When rating degree to which functioning is disrupted by hallucinations, include preoccupation with the content and experience of the hallucinations, as well as functioning disrupted by acting out on the hallucinatory content (e.g., engaging in deviant behavior due to command hallucinations). Include \"thoughts aloud\" (\"gedankenlautwerden\") or pseudohallucinations (e.g., hears a voice inside head) if a voice quality is present.",
